# Coulomb3D
A 3D visualizer of an electric field based on vectors at their respective locations in space. 

This is a minor project for me to learn to implement 3D graphics.

<b>Note:</b> This project is not finished yet; I'm missing to implement the algorithm to calculate forces at each point in space, and fix some bugs.
